        <h3> about me! </h3>
        <p>im a nerd for all things video game and movie related, i also write and do karaoke sometimes.</p>
        <p>one of the biggest influences on my life has been from music, a lot can be said about a person through the
            music they listen to and create.</p>
        <p>if anything, id push that logic further, you can tell a lot about a person through what they creat and enjoy
            to surround themselves with.</p>
        <p>but how does that connect to me?</p>
        <p>its important because one of if not my favorite kind of media is cyberpunk, a massive genre that warns of the dangers our future could hold if we keep going the way we are now</p>
